Projection operator method for statistical data analysis (Fortran90 or Python3)


### Overview ###

The Mori-Zwanzig projection operator method splits ensembles of the analyzed time-series data <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?f(t)^i" /> into correlated and uncorrelated parts with regard to the variable of interests <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?u(t)^i" />.
